      <h2>Sleep Yourself to A Better Memory?</h2>
      <p>
        Every lifestyle choice has the potential to affect your cognitive abilities and health.
        In recent years, various researchers have found that a habit that most of us take for granted
        — sleep — may affect our memory in noticeable ways.</br>
        Does sleep help long term memories stick?</br>
        In a study published in the June 2011 issue of Science, University of Washington researchers studied
        how sleep might impact long-term memories. How? By using a special breed of fruit flies that could be
        induced to sleep on demand.
